                    Brothers Josiah and Isaiah Schu were raised in Colfax Washington. They met coincidentally on the day of Isaiah's birth. Since then, they've been as close as
                    brothers; and soon, with Isaiah learning drums and Josiah learning bass, they were well on their way to
                    becoming a struggling duo of almost musicians.

                    After 15 years of playing and learning to produce and play additional instruments they recorded
                    their first album Dollar Bread under the band name Squalm in their filthy house in Moscow Idaho,
                    with the help of guitarist/cult leader Marcus Mead.

                    In 2022, just after the release of their album, they set off to struggle even harder in the big
                    city. In Portland Oregon, they met Phil Felicia, their current guitarist, and are well on their
                    way to a more rewarding and fruitful struggle.
